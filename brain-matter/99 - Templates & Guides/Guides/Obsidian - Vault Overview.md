### Summary of How My [[Obsidian]] Vault Works

Your [[Obsidian]] Vault is structured to maximize organization, accessibility, and efficiency in managing your academic and personal information. Here's a breakdown of the key sections within your vault:

#### Resources Section

**Path**: `/brain-matter/00 - Resources`

The Resources section is dedicated to storing all external information that you gather. This includes articles, reports, studies, videos, and any other media. It serves as the foundation of your research, providing a repository of valuable information that you can refer to and learn from. For example, you might have a resource titled [[The Effect of Folder Structure on Personal File Navigation]].

#### Knowledge Section

**Path**: `/brain-matter/01 - Knowledge`

The Knowledge section is where you keep general notes on various topics. This is the heart of your vault, where you synthesize and connect what you learn from your resources. Notes in this section can cover anything and everything, allowing you to build a comprehensive knowledge base. For instance, you might have a note titled [[Notes - The Effect of Folder Structure on Personal File Navigation]] that expands on the insights gained from the corresponding resource.

#### [[Excalidraw]] Section

**Path**: `/brain-matter/02 - Excalidraw`

The [[Excalidraw]] section is used as a canvas for thinking and creating diagrams. This is where you can visually map out concepts, create flowcharts, and sketch ideas to enhance understanding and communication. It integrates the visual aspects of your thinking process with your textual notes.

#### Daily Notes

**Path**: `/brain-matter/03 - Daily Notes`

The Daily Notes section allows you to take daily general notes on thoughts, plans, and reflections. You don't have to take daily notes every day, but by clicking on the date in the calendar or the icon on the left sidebar, you can easily create and manage these entries. This section helps you keep track of your daily activities and insights.

#### Presentations Folder

**Path**: `/brain-matter/04 - Presentations`

The Presentations folder is where you store all your presentation materials. This includes slides, outlines, and any supporting documents needed for delivering presentations. It ensures that all your presentation resources are organized and easily accessible.

#### Attachments Folder

**Path**: `/brain-matter/05 - Attachments`

The Attachments folder is used for storing all file attachments that you reference in your notes. This includes images, PDFs, and other documents. Keeping attachments in a dedicated folder helps maintain an organized structure within your vault.

#### Templates & Guides Folder

**Path**: `/brain-matter/99 - Templates & Guides`

The Templates & Guides folder contains all your note templates and guides. Templates help ensure consistency across your notes and save time by providing predefined structures for common types of notes. This is particularly useful for maintaining a standard format in your research and note-taking processes.

#### Smart Connections

**Path**: `/smart-chats`

The Smart Connections plugin enhances your ability to manage and retrieve information within your vault. The Smart Chats folder holds all your past chats, making it easy to revisit and search through your previous interactions. This feature allows you to utilize AI to explore connections and insights in your notes, helping you uncover hidden relationships and enhance your research.
### How It All Works Together

- **Resources** provide the foundational information that feeds into your **Knowledge**.
- **Knowledge** notes connect and expand on the insights gained from **Resources**. For example, your resource [[The Effect of Folder Structure on Personal File Navigation]] would have a corresponding knowledge note titled [[Notes - The Effect of Folder Structure on Personal File Navigation]].
- **Excalidraw** aids in visualizing and brainstorming ideas, linking them back to your **Knowledge**.
- **Daily Notes** help you capture daily thoughts and plans, integrating them into your overall knowledge base.
- **Presentations** are created using the synthesized information from **Knowledge** and **Resources**.
- **Attachments** are linked throughout your vault to provide supplementary information.
- **Templates** ensure your notes are consistently formatted and organized efficiently.
- **Smart Connections** allow you to leverage AI ( *[[gpt-3.5]] developed by [[OpenAI]]* ) for discovering insights and connections within your notes, enhancing the depth and breadth of your research.

In addition, we use #subject to denote core subjects within our notes. This tagging system helps in organizing and categorizing the vast amount of information within the vault. For instance, the file [[Obsidian]] refers to the core subject of our note-taking system, whereas [[Obsidian - Plugins|plugins]] refers to a smaller portion of this larger core subject. This distinction helps in managing and retrieving information effectively.

By structuring your vault in this way, you create a cohesive system where information flows logically from gathering resources to building knowledge, visualizing ideas, and presenting your findings. This setup not only enhances your productivity but also helps you maintain a well-organized and easily navigable vault.
