# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

### Basic Markdown Syntax

- **Headers**: Use `#` for headers. The number of `#` signs indicates the level of the header.

  ```

  # H1

  ## H2

  ### H3
  
  #### H4

  ##### H5
  
  ###### H6

  ```

>[!Example]
># H1
>## H2
>### H3
>#### H4
>##### H5
>###### H6

- **Emphasis**: Use `*` or `_` for italic and `**` or `__` for bold.

  ```

  *italic* or _italic_

  **bold** or __bold__

  ```

>[!Example]
>*italic* or _italic_
>**bold** or __bold__
### Lists

  - **Unordered lists**: Use `*`, `+`, or `-`.

    ```

    - Item 1

    * Item 2

    ```

>[!Example]
> - Item 1
> * Item 2

  - **Ordered lists**: Use numbers followed by a period.

    ```

    1. Item 1

    2. Item 2

    ```

>[!Example]
> 1. Item 1
> 2.  Item 2

- **Links**: Use `[Link Text](URL)`.

  ```

  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

  ```

> [!Example]
>   [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

- **Images**: Use `![Alt Text](URL)` for images online or use this format ```![[obsidian-logo.png]]``` if you have downloaded images. To easily get them into your vault drag and drop them and they will automatically go to the Attachments Folder and show up visually in your notes.

```

- **Callouts**: Obsidian allows you to create callouts to highlight important information.

  ```

  > [!important]
  > This is an important callout.

  ```

> [!important]
 This is an important callout.
