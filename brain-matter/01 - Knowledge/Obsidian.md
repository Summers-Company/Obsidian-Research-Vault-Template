# Philosophy

[[Obsidian]] is a note-taking app where you edit simple text files known as [[Markdown]] ( *â—€ press ctrl as you hover over the highlighted word 'Markdown' for a surprise!*  ) files which are enhanced with many powerful easy to use features. Unlike cloud-based apps like [[Notion]], [[Obsidian]] stores your data locally on your machine, giving you full control over your notes.

> [!important] 
> If the company behind [[Obsidian]] ever went down then you would still just have all your notes on your computer. They are just markdown files ```.md extension``` so could be imported into a new app

### Why Obsidian?

The core idea behind [[Obsidian]] is to move away from rigid folder structures and instead focus on capturing your ideas freely. By linking these ideas together, a natural structure emerges that aligns with your unique way of thinking. This approach not only enhances your note-taking but also allows you to leverage AI to gain deeper insights from your notes.

>[!Example]
> ### Rigid File Structures vs. Obsidian for a Meme
> 
> #### Rigid File Structures
> 
> Imagine you come across a meme that is funny, features a cat, and involves a piano. In a traditional file structure, you might struggle to decide where to save this meme. Do you put it in:
> 
> - **Humor Folder**: Because it's funny.
> - **Cats Folder**: Because it has a cat.
> - **Music Folder**: Because there's a piano.
> 
> You might end up duplicating the file into multiple folders, which can quickly become a disorganized mess, or you might save it in just one folder and struggle to find it later because it fits multiple categories.
> 
> #### Obsidian
> 
> In Obsidian, you don't have to worry about fitting this meme into a single rigid category. Instead, you can:
> 
> 1. **Create a Note for the Meme**: You can create a note titled "Funny Cat Piano Meme".
> 2. **Tag and Link**: Add relevant tags like `#funny`, `#cat`, `#piano`, and `#meme`.
> 3. **Link to Related Notes**: If you have other notes about memes, cats, or pianos, you can create links to those notes.
> 
> This way, when you want to find this meme, you can search by any tag or keyword, and Obsidian will show you all related notes. The note can exist in multiple contexts without needing to duplicate it. This approach allows you to effortlessly retrieve and connect your notes based on any attribute or context you remember, leveraging the full power of linked ideas and tags.

Using [[Obsidian]] for note-taking and information management in academia offers a flexible and powerful alternative to rigid file structures. By linking these ideas together, _structure can naturally form_ that matches your way of thinking. This dynamic approach not only simplifies your workflow but also enhances your ability to connect ideas and gain deeper insights from your notes.

# Concepts

### Obsidian Graph View and "Ghost Topics"

One of the standout features of [[Obsidian]] is the Graph View, which visually represents the connections between your notes. This powerful tool helps you see the relationships between different pieces of information, making it easier to understand and navigate your knowledge base.

#### Graph View

The Graph View displays your notes as nodes connected by lines, representing the links between them (*To see the graph view it should be in the bottom right of your vault if not press the ```open graph view``` button in the left side panel*).

- **Node Size**: The size of each node increases with the number of links it has. This makes it easy to identify your most connected notes at a glance.
- **Clusters**: Notes that are closely related form clusters, helping you see how different topics and ideas group together.
- **Navigation**: Clicking on a node brings you directly to that note, allowing you to explore your connections easily.

> [!About] 
> #### Benefits
> - **Visual Relationships**: See how your ideas and notes are interconnected.
> - **Identify Key Notes**: Larger nodes highlight the most linked and potentially important notes in your vault.

#### "Ghost Topics"

"Ghost Topics" are concepts or ideas that you link to frequently but haven't created a dedicated note for yet. These are placeholders or potential notes that you can flesh out later.

- **Creating Links**: You can create links to these ghost topics using `[[ ]]` even if the note doesn't exist yet. This way, you can link related notes to these topics as they arise. For example, if you link to [[Notion]] and [[Obsidian]], you'll notice that [[Notion]] is a darker link compared to [[Obsidian]] as the note for [[Notion]] doesn't exist yet. This visual cue helps you differentiate between existing and non-existing notes.

- **Identifying Growth**: As you continue to link to these ghost topics, you might notice certain ones becoming more central to your research. When a ghost topic has many links, it indicates that it's a significant concept worth creating a dedicated note for.

- **Easy Visibility**: Another benefit of ghost topics is that when you type `[[` to create a link, [[Obsidian]] will show you all files, including ghost topics. This makes it easy to see and manage your ghost topics as you create new notes.

> [!About] 
> #### Benefits
> 
> - **Flexibility**: Allows you to create connections without needing to have a full note ready.
> - **Scalability**: Helps you identify emerging themes and topics that are becoming important in your research.
> - **Proactive Organization**: Encourages you to stay on top of growing topics and organize your notes effectively.


### Using Graph View and Ghost Topics in Academic Research

The Graph View and the concept of "Ghost Topics" enhance your ability to manage and visualize your research. By using these features, you can:

- **Track the Evolution of Ideas**: See how your understanding and research on a topic develop over time.
- **Identify Key Themes**: Recognize which concepts are central to your work and need further exploration.
- **Optimize Your Notes**: Efficiently manage your notes by identifying when to convert ghost topics into fully fleshed-out notes.

These tools make [[Obsidian]] not just a note-taking app, but a dynamic environment for academic research and knowledge management, helping you uncover connections and insights that might otherwise be missed.
### Front Matter in Obsidian

Obsidian allows you to add metadata to your notes using a feature called front matter. Front matter is written in YAML format and placed at the top of your Markdown files between triple dashes (`---`). This metadata can include information such as the title, author, date, tags, and more. It helps organize your notes and makes it easier to search and filter them within Obsidian.

For example, a note with front matter might look like this:

```yaml
---
title: "Research on AI"
author: "Jane Doe"
date: "2024-05-31"
tags: ["AI", "research", "machine learning"]
---
```

In this example:
- **title**: The title of the note.
- **author**: The author of the note.
- **date**: The creation or last modification date of the note.
- **tags**: Keywords associated with the note for easier searching and categorization.

Using front matter in Obsidian helps you keep your notes organized and enhances the functionality of your second brain by allowing you to add meaningful context to each note.

### Using Tags in Obsidian

Tags in Obsidian are a simple yet powerful way to categorize and organize your notes. They help you quickly find and connect related information, making your note-taking system more efficient and intuitive.

**What are Tags?**

Tags are keywords or labels that you add to your notes using a `#` symbol followed by the tag name, like `#research` or `#meeting`. They can be placed anywhere in your note, and you can use multiple tags in a single note.

#### Why Use Tags?

- **Organization**: Tags help categorize notes by topics, projects, or any criteria you choose.
- **Searchability**: Quickly search and filter notes by tags to access related information.
- **Flexibility**: Unlike folders, tags are not hierarchical, allowing for a more fluid organization.

#### How to Use Tags

1. **Adding Tags**: Type `#` followed by the tag name, e.g., `#research`.
2. **Multiple Tags**: Use multiple tags in a note for broader categorization, e.g., `#research`, `#meeting`.
3. **Tag Pane**: Access the Tag Pane from the sidebar to view and navigate all tags in your vault.

> [!Info]
> For a note about a research meeting on AI, you could use tags like `#research`, `#meeting`, and `#AI`. Later, search for `#AI` to find all related notes.
> > [!Example]
> > I am a #research note that is about #AI being used for solving a problem

#### Advanced Tag Usage

- **Nested Tags**: Create detailed categories with nested tags like `#research/AI`.
- **Tag Combinations**: Search for notes with multiple tags, e.g., `#research` and `#AI`.

#### Benefits

Tags provide a flexible and dynamic way to organize your notes, enhancing your ability to link related ideas and manage information efficiently. They make Obsidian a powerful tool for academic research and personal knowledge management.
