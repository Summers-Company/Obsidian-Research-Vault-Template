Front matter is a way to include metadata at the beginning of a Markdown file. This metadata is often used to provide information about the document, such as the title, author, date, tags, and other relevant details. In Obsidian and many other Markdown-based tools, front matter is defined using YAML (Yet Another Markup Language).
### Structure of Front Matter

Front matter is enclosed within a pair of triple dashes (`---`) at the beginning of the file. Here is an example:

```yaml

---

title: "Understanding Front Matter"

author: "John Doe"

date: "2024-05-31"

tags: ["markdown", "front matter", "obsidian"]

---

```

#### In this example:

- **title**: The title of the document.

- **author**: The author of the document.

- **date**: The date the document was created or last updated.

- **tags**: A list of tags associated with the document.

### Benefits of Using Front Matter

1. **Organization**: Helps organize your notes by providing a consistent way to add metadata.

2. **Searchability**: Enhances search functionality by allowing you to filter and find documents based on metadata.

3. **Display Customization**: Some tools can use front matter to customize how documents are displayed.

### Using Front Matter in Obsidian

In Obsidian, front matter can be used to define various properties that enhance your note-taking and organization. For example, you can use front matter to:

- Set the title of the note.

- Add tags for better categorization.

- Specify the creation or modification date.

- Include any other custom metadata that you find useful.

#### Here is an example of front matter in an Obsidian note:

```yaml

---

title: "My Research Note"

author: "Jane Smith"

date: "2024-05-31"

tags: ["research", "notes", "obsidian"]

---

```

### Advanced Usage

You can include more complex metadata and even nested structures in your front matter. For example:

```yaml

---

title: "Advanced Front Matter Example"

author:

  name: "Alice Johnson"

  email: "alice@example.com"

date: "2024-05-31"

tags:

  - "advanced"

  - "front matter"

  - "yaml"

categories:

  - "markdown"

  - "obsidian"

---

```
#### In this example:

- **author**: Contains nested fields for the author's name and email.

- **tags**: A list of tags.

- **categories**: A list of categories.
### Conclusion

Front matter is a powerful feature that allows you to add structured metadata to your Markdown files. This metadata can enhance the organization, searchability, and customization of your notes in Obsidian and other Markdown-based tools. By using front matter, you can create a more efficient and organized note-taking system.
