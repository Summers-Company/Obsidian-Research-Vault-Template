**Published**: 2010, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology

### Research Objective
Investigate the relationship between folder structure and the efficiency of personal file navigation.

>[!About]
>### Methodology
> - **Participants**: 296
> - **Tasks**: Retrieving 1,131 active files
> - **Analysis**: 5,035 navigation steps

### Key Findings

#### Folder Structure
- **Depth**: Shallow structures were common, with an average retrieval depth of 2.86 folders.
- **Size**: Folders typically contained 11.82 files and many subfolders (average 10.64).

#### Navigation Efficiency
- **Success Rate**: 94% of files were successfully accessed.
- **Retrieval Time**: Average time to retrieve a file was 14.76 seconds.
- **Impact of Structure**: Both folder depth and size significantly affected retrieval time and success.

#### Optimization
- Users tend to avoid deep structures and large folders, which seems to be an adaptive strategy for efficient navigation.
- A predictive model was developed to determine the optimal balance between folder depth and size for efficient file retrieval.

### Conclusion

The study suggests that well-organized, shallow folder structures with manageable folder sizes enhance personal file navigation efficiency. Implications for personal information management include designing folder systems that minimize depth and avoid overloading folders with too many files.
