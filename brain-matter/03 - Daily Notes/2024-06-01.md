# 📝 Todays Notes


- I found a very interesting article named [[The effect of folder structure on personal file navigation]] and took some notes on it in [[Notes - The Effect of Folder Structure on Personal File Navigation]]

- Later I want to apply this to [[What is the best file structure for personal navigation?]]

- Today I also learned about how to use [[OpenAI]] and their [[gpt-3.5]] model to aid in my research process!
